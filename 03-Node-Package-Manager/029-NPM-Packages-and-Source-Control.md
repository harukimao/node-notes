## NPM Packages and Source Control

- Node modules folder too big so you dont send the modules
- Our package.json contains all the dependency info
- If they npm init it will reinstall all those dependencies
- Make a .gitignore file and to exclude node modules write node_modules/ the / indicates its a folder
- run git status to see which files will be uploaded
